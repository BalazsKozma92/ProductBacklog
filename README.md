# Product-Backlog

In the agile world is crutial to be able to track our work. One tool for this is the product backlog where the Product Owners can collect their ideas named backlog items. After they added the items with description and acceptance criteria the team can assign an effort to this item and split them into concrete tasks. Your work is to create a simple version of Product backlog.
